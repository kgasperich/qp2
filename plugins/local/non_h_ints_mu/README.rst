=============
non_h_ints_mu
=============

Computes the non hermitian potential of the mu-TC Hamiltonian on the AO and BI-ORTHO MO basis.
The operator is defined in Eq. 33 of JCP 154, 084119 (2021)

The two providers are :
+) ao_non_hermit_term_chemist which returns the non hermitian part of the two-electron TC Hamiltonian on the MO basis. 
+) mo_non_hermit_term_chemist which returns the non hermitian part of the two-electron TC Hamiltonian on the BI-ORTHO MO basis.
